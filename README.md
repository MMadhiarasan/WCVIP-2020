Image Captioning Using Deep Neural Network
The implementation of image captioning using deep neural network consist of
following steps:
Step 1: Import all the necessary packages
Step 2: Load the data and perform the date preprocessing
Step 3: Extracting the feature vector from images using transfer learning
(Xception Model)
Step 4: Load the preprocessed data to model for the purpose of training
Step5: Tokenizing the vocabulary
Step 6: Create data generator
Step 7: Define the structure of model (CNN â€“LSTMs)
Step 8: Perform training process
Step 9: Perform testing process
Step 10: Output
